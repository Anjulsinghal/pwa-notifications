## 📂 GitHub Repository

[Repository Link](https://github.com/Anjulsinghal/pwa-notifications)

## ✨ Features

- **Service Worker** for offline support
- **Push Notifications** with multiple types (Info, Success, Warning, Error)
- **Installable** as a standalone application
- **Responsive Design** with Tailwind CSS
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds

## 📱 Installation

The "Install App" button will only appear when:
1. The app is accessed via HTTPS (deployed site)
2. The user hasn't already installed the app
3. The app meets PWA criteria (has a valid manifest, registered service worker, etc.)

> **Note:** The install option will not appear in localhost development environments. To test the installation feature, please use the deployed version.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

## 🔧 How It Works

### Service Worker

The service worker (`sw.js`) handles:
- Caching static assets for offline use
- Intercepting network requests
- Managing push notifications
- Background sync operations

### Notifications

The app demonstrates two ways to implement notifications:
1. **Basic Notifications**: Text-based notifications with the original component
2. **Typed Notifications**: Four different notification types (Info, Success, Warning, Error)

### Installation

The PWA can be installed on supported devices and browsers. The installation prompt is handled by the browser, and our app provides a custom "Install App" button when the conditions are met.
